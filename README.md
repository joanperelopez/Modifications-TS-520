# Modifications-TS-520


I Started reparing and adjusting my Kenwood transceiver TS-520, but I saw some articles about how to create a device to read the frequency of operation. I decide to include it. I continued including new features as: s-meter, band indicator, spectrum frequency, mode of operation and some others indicators.
As appeared in the picture I use two microcontrollers: one for display and interface, and the second one for the FFT.

You can use all the documentation that appears in the repository as long as it is not used for commercial purposes.

The experiments for the design of the electronic circuits and the microcontroller began with a breadboard and the RF circuits mounted directly on a copper plate.

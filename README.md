# Modifications-TS-520


I Started reparing and adjusting my Kenwood transceiver TS-520, but I saw some articles about how to create a device to read the frequency of operation. I continued including new features as: s-meter, band indicator, spectrum frequency, mode of operation and some others indicators.

The experiments for the design of the electronic circuits and the microcontroller began with a breadboard and the RF circuits mounted directly on a copper plate.
